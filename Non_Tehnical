Question:
How will you handle such a merchant and manage the expectations of Peter in preventing Churn.

Answer:
a. As a Technical support, I will:
1. Review the logs of the last issue encountered on the merchants account to look out for pointers to the root cause
ii.Turn on trace and have them perform a live transaction so I can also review
iii. Check that the integration was mapped to the correct APIs.
iii. Engage our Dev Team and provide them the details of my investigation for root cause identification

Given that other merchants are consuming this same service without complaints, it appears the challenge is peculiar to the merchant.

Firstly, I will engage the merchant by apologizing for the inconveniences the error has impacted on his business and 
let him know that we are working assiduously to identify the root cause and fix promptly.

Once the root cause has been identified, I will ensure that a hot fix is provided for this merchant firstly to avert further losses on mercfhants business
pending a proper fix by our Dev Team.

I will also ensure that an hourly update is sent to the merchant to let him know the efforts Pbeing put in place to address the complaints.


b. Peter is our staff. I will add him to the group call to see the work done in order to resolve the issue.
