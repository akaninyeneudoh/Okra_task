1. Question:
Hey Okra team, I’m trying to get the latest transactions and I’m hitting the https://api.okra.ng/v2/transactions/getById but 
it’s only giving me a week old transactions for some reason. Please help! Jesse

Answer:
Hello Jesse,
Thanks for your email. 

We have reviewed your email and we would advise you try hitting https://api.okra.ng/v2/transactions/getByCustomerDate which has the criteria to 
specify the transaction date range and customer id.

I am standby for feedback or further support.

Hi! I’ve setup the Widget and I can connect the account, however I don’t understand how to programmatically indicate that the connection
was successful or it thrown an error. Thanks in advance. Mike

Answer:
Hello Mike,
Thanks for your email.

We have reviewed your email and advise that since you can connect to an account, it appears the connection is successful. 
However, we would advise you further perform a transaction or an enquiry to see if you will encounter an error.

I am standby for feedback or further support.

Hello, my name is Blessing and I would like to understand how do I test Okra. I wouldn’t like to pay for my testing.

Answer:
Hi Blessing,

Thanks for your email.
In Okra, testing is free for registered merchants via the Okra sandbox environmnent.
However if you are a new user, we can onboard you and grant you access to a test account on the Okra sandbox environment.
