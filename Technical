Question:
Given the following, can you troubleshoot why the customer is having issues with these routes? 
a. https://docs.okra.ng/reference/fetchauths

Answer:
I think the customer is having issue with the route because the API does not specify a search criteria using the customer id. 

Consequently this API would retrieve bank details for all registered custommers.

I would advise the customer uses the https://docs.okra.ng/reference/getByCustomerDate. This API would ensure that the bank details retrieved is limited 
to the customer, using the customer id.


b. https://docs.okra.ng/reference/getidentitybydate
Answer:
I think the customer is having issue with the route because the API does not specify a search criteria using the customer id. 

Consequently this API would retrieve identity profiles for all users in a given date range

I would advise the customer uses the https://docs.okra.ng/reference/getByCustomerDate. This API would ensure that the identity profile retrieved 
is limited to the customer, using the customer id.
